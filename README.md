# Test 1

## To use
You don't need to do anything, all less styles are already compiled into dist/styles/master.css
In case you want to modify some styles do the following:

### Node

```sh
npm install
```
Change styles needed and when you are done and want those styles compiled into dist/styles/master.css do:

```sh
gulp
```

That will make your new styles appear at dist/styles/master.css.
